### User Stories


### Site Owner Goals
My goal was to create a fun jungle styled game where the user can match various cards of animals. The game should have varying levels of difficulty so that the user can progress forward through the game and get more of an experience. I want to implement sound in the form of ambient sound to create a more realistic in-depth experience for the user when they play the game. There should be notifications of success and failure and something that identifys how your doing through-out the game process.

### User requirements and expectations
- The user should be able to match cards from different visual images
- The user should be able to identify and memorize locations of multiple images 
- the user should be able to move around a basic website
- the user should be able to progress through different difficulties of the game
- The user is expected to complete the game in a set amount of time


### Colours


### Font and styling
 I decided to style this game with the mindset that the target audience would be aimed at more children than adults even though, adults are welcome to play the game. The game as a simple cartoonish style with an aim on cartoon animals as the main things to match with-in the game. Thus the game was given a more jungle atmosphere and jungle music to create a more immersive experience through-out.
 I decided to stick with a more earthy colour scheme and thus its based off of a lot of greens and browns in accordance to the nature of the game.
 The font that was used is a more Cursive styled font to keep the game in the more childish and fun nature than structured and orderly. Its meant ot be more of an experience for the users than information being provided.
